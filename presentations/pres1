How do you get the future you want?

It's simple, by following in the right footsteps in the present.

But present is quite complex and our short term memory makes it quite difficult to see the big picture which is instrumental in the development of the habits necessary to achieve your long term goals.

So how do you tackle this problem?


One solution to this issue is keeping a journal.

By setting out a simple goal and logging all steps taken towards that goal you can strengthen your moments of reflection and get progressively better at the thing you're doing over time.

But. One thing doesn't get you very far.

Sometimes we want to achieve two things simultaneously,
or three,
or 11 ...

So instead of keeping just one tidy journal, we now end up with stacks of books that we need to log every single day. That is an accountant's job. And we don't have time for that.
