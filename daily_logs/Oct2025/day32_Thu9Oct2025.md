# Activities

3am - Researched MIME types.

3:20am - MIME (Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions) type is essentially like an instruction given to the browser. It's metadata that tells the browser how to interpret a given data stream without the need for creating that file with that type. So When you create a `<script type="text/javascript">` tag, you're telling the browser "interpret the data inside the tag as you would a javascript file".

3:25am - Researched `Accept - ` header.

3:30am - The `Accept -` header is a header than can be used on either end of the exchange (client or host), which tells the other party what data types (expressed as MIME types) that party is equipped to handle. For example, 

3:45am - Researched HATEOAS

4:30am - Added explicit methods to endpoints' functions,

5am - Made sure every response includes a status code,

5:30am - 

1pm - Wrote a reflection on this project.
