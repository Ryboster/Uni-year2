# Activities

1am - Thought of a strong opening to a song. Went songwriting.

4am - Wrote a song. Composed a melody for it.

5am -

7:30pm - Moved all whiteboard images to my PC
7:50pm - Sketched up a quick tidy ERD of the new movement controller.
8pm - Fixed my crontab (finally)

8:10pm - Carried on catching up with daily logs. It was a busy week working on SL and so prioritizing SL, I neglected my daily logs.



9pm - Found a problem with the way MarkText interprets dragged-and-dropped images. Instead of the `markdown` syntax (`![alt text](src "name")`), it kept pasting it in `HTML` syntax (`<img src="path" ...>`).

9:25pm - Found a solution to the problem. It's only converted to HTML if you resize the picture because markdown doesn't have an equivalent to `height` and `width` attributes of an `img` tag.
