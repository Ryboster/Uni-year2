* 2 mistakes -
  
  * **aggregation** (hollow rhombus) should've been **ownership** (filled rhombus).
  
  * the aggregation arrow should be pointing the **other way**.

* Entity owns `UMC` (`UniversalMovementController`). `UMC` **is** a `Driver`. `Driver` extends `InputProvider`.

2pm - Attended ASD meeting.

2:20pm - Listened to Ben Williams' pitch. He wants to develop an app that scrapes an area drawn on the map. The idea itself is good and i'd love to work for him, but he's not a software developer and he has some dubious assumptions about how it would work. I should speak with him and see if I could join his project.

2:45pm - Listened to Lauren Keenan's pitch. She wants to develop a wellbeing app that compares screen time spent on social media apps to equivalent CO2 emissions. I'm personally not a fan of this idea.

3pm - Announced my own pitch next week. I want to work on a device that helps you achieve lucid dreams by giving you auditory cues when you're in REM (rapid eye movement) phase.

4pm - Started working on the presentation. Got strong starting hook.

6pm - Carried on thinking about the navigation problem. Briefly discussed it with Bogdan. Explored different avenues and ways of solving it.
