# Activities

1am -  Designed a new custom movement controller for NPCs in my game.

1:30am - Made a UML chart of the design

2pm - Attended ASD meeting.

2:20pm - Listened to Ben Williams' pitch. He wants to develop an app that scrapes an area drawn on the map. The idea itself is good and i'd love to work for him, but he's not a software developer and he has some dubious assumptions about how it would work.

2:45pm - Listened to Lauren Keenan's pitch. She wants to develop a wellbeing app that equates screen time spent on social media apps to CO2 emissions. I'm personally not a fan of this idea.

3pm - Announced my own pitch next week. I want to work on a device that helps you achieve lucid dreams.

4pm - Started working on the presentation. Got strong starting hook.
