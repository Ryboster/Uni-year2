# Activities

<12am - Over the weekend I explored other ways of solving my navigational problem ([day 7 - Issues/Errors Section](day7_Fri12Sep2025.md)) including  periodically spawning in a giant `SphereCollider` to get a list of each unique `GameObject` that the NPC can "see". This would be WAY more efficient but I'm still not 100% happy with this solution.

1am - Started working on a new controller component "`UniversalMovementController`" that would handle movement for all in-game entities.

1:20am - Started by sketching up a workflow diagram and assigning specific responsibilities to different entities (Entities in red). Then sketched up another diagram for the new responsibility I wanted to introduce - Applying terrain modifier to movement speed.

2am - Explored different ways of detection of that slope. Discussed it with Bogdan.
