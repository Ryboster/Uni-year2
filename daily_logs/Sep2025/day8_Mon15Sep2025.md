# Activities

<12am - Over the weekend I explored other ways of solving my navigational problem ([day 7](day7_Fri12Sep2025.md) including  periodically spawning in a giant `SphereCollider` to get a list of each unique `GameObject` that the NPC can "see". This would be WAY more efficient but I'm still not 100% happy with this solution.

1am - Started working on 

9pm - Discussed different methods of giving NPCs eyesight in our Unity project with Bogdan.
