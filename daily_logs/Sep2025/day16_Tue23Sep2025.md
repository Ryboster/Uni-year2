# Activities

6am - Wakey wakey

6:30am - Thought of new endpoints. Came up with the idea to make a couple different templates for logs (e.g. a timeline, a journal, and a journal of tables) and give
 the user the ability to create as many new logs as they want for 
whatever purpose they need em. This will make the site a lot more modular, users will get a lot more utility out of it, and I won't have to work on manually adding new endpoints whenever I think of logging a new thing.

7am - Quick break.
