# Activities

3:30am - Wakey wakey.

4am - Back to upgrading the database.

4:35am - Resolved the bug I spent over an hour on yesterday.

4:55am - Decided to replace the `Entry_ID` field in my `Entries` table with `date` because `date` is stored as unix time and the website doesn't let you edit the date - it just grabs the current time. Which means `date` is more of an `Entry_ID` than `Entry_ID`, and it's more accessible.

7am - Vastly streamlined `home.js` file. 150 line reduction.

7:25am - Fixed the whole CRUD.

7:40am - Tidied up the code all around.

8am - Got to work on a quick script for repopulation

9:25am - Successfully repopulated the whole database. No data was lost.

9:50am - Started working on adding activity and category edit forms.

12pm - Quick break. Did some basic research on face moisturizers and emolients. Planned the next four 3d prints.

4:50pm - Resolved many outsdanding bugs with the code. Added category and activity edit forms. Streamlined usage and population of forms. Added more entry points to the edit forms (On add entry and in new `categories` view.)

5:20pm - Added a new log.

5:40pm - Added more categories and activities and tidied the whole thing a bit.

5:50pm - Made some quick changes to CSS to make it look a bit better. Mainly just increased the size of the mood on each entry.

6pm - Sleepy time.
