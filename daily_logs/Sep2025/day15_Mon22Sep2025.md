# Activities

3:30am - Wakey wakey.

4am - Back to upgrading the database.

4:35am - Resolved the bug I spent over an hour on yesterday.

4:55am - Decided to replace the `Entry_ID` field in my `Entries` table with `date` because `date` is stored as unix time and the website doesn't let you edit the date - it just grabs the current time. Which means `date` is more of an `Entry_ID` than `Entry_ID`, and it's more accessible.

7am - Vastly streamlined `home.js` file. 150 line reduction.

7:25am - Fixed the whole CRUD.

7:40am - Tidied up the code all around.

8am - Got to work on a quick script for repopulation

9:25am - Successfully repopulated the whole database. No data was lost.

9:50am - Started working on adding activity and category edit forms.
