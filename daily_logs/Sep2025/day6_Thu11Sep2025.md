# Activities

12:05pm - Got to work on redesigning the simulator used in training of `LocomotiveBrain` for my NPCs. The problem was that I tried removing the agents and map during training, which is not supported. Instead of that, I'm going to "reshuffle" the whole level.

2pm - Done "reshuffling". Instead of throwing out the baby with the bathwater, now the simulator simply changes the positions of every entity in level when objective is reached. 

2:30pm - Done some fine tuning. Readjusted the number of agents per level. Augmented some of the parameters.

3pm - Designed additional observations and compiled a list of changes for later. With these changes, agents will be more aware of their environment and should -at least in theory- learn better.

3:50pm - Opened a github repository in place of the bitbucket one.

4pm - Fixed my automated commit software. Fine tuned all software for the new repository.

4:15pm - Wrote this log. 

4:20pm - Got to work on reflections.

4:30pm - Contacted Creality about my 3D printer order. Apparently they delivered it to a random hotel???
