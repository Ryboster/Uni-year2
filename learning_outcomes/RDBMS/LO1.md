# Identify and use the processes and terminology used in designing a RDBMS

### Abstract

----------------------------------------------

#### Overview

Database normalization is the process of structuring relational databases in a way that reduces data redundancies and increases data integrity by reducing anomalies. It is accomplished by adhering to so-called normal forms that are sets of progressively strict rules constraining the database.

A relational database is an abstract idea of tables wherein columns (fields) and rows (records) are related in some way to columns and rows of other tables. There are three types of relationships in relational databases. Those are:

1. One-to-many Relationship: Here, one record from table A can be associated with multiple records in table B.

2. Many-to-many Relationship: Here, multiple records from table A can be associated with multiple records in table B.

3. One-to-one Relationship: Here, only one record from table A can be associated with a single record in table B.

A relational database management system (RDBMS) is software that provides tools necessary for creation and management of such tables, and for interaction with their data. An example here could be the `sqlite3` python library. It provides:

* tools to **create, read, update, and delete** (CRUD) data,

* a query language (SQL),

* enforcement of relational concepts such as **primary keys and foreign keys.**

Relational databases define two concepts called Entities and Attributes. An entity is a category of the thing or person you're trying to describe; for example an employee. An attribute is what you can use to describe that object with; for example, every employee has an ID and salary.

### Normal forms

#### Unnormalized Form (UNF)

An unnormalized form is the crudest type of database. No rules are applied here.

This form focuses more on "sketching out" the database schema. At this step you would normally identify your entities and degrees of relationships.

#### First Normal Form (1NF)

The first normal form enforces atomicity of fields. In this form, every field must be **atomic**, i.e. indivisable.

An atomic field is a field that holds a **single indivisable** value. **Single** means that it cannot be a collection of values such as a dictionary. **Indivisable** means that the value cannot be logically divided any further; it constitutes a single whole value.

#### Second Normal Form (2NF)

The second normal form eliminates **partial dependencies**. 

A partial dependency occurs when a non-key attribute is dependent on only a part of a composite key instead of the whole key. For example:

 <table>
  <tr>
     <th>Order ID:PK</th>
     <th>Product ID:FK</th>
     <th>Product Name</th>
     <th>Quantity</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>0</td>
     <td>403</td>
     <td>Fruit</td>
     <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

In here, **Product Name** attribute is only *really* dependent on **Product ID**, but you need both **Order ID** and **Product ID** to access it. This is a **partial dependency.** To now make this table compliant with 2NF, we need to eliminate it:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Order ID:PK</th>
<th>Product ID:FK</th>
<th>Quantity</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>403</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Product ID:PK</th>
    <th>Product Name</th>
<tr>
    <td>403</td>
    <td>Fruit</td>
</table>

Now **Product Name** is only dependent on **Product ID**, and only that is required to retrieve it.

#### Third Normal Form (3NF)

The third normal form eliminates **transitive dependencies.**

A transitive dependency occurs when a non-key attribute is dependent on another non-key attribute. If B depends on A, and C depends on B, then C commits transitive dependency because it also depends on A. For example, the following table has a transitive dependency:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Entry ID:PK</th>
<th>Date</th>
<th>Day Of Week</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>3/10/2025</td>
<td>Friday</td>
</tr>
</table>

Here, **Date**, which is a non-key attribute, depends on **Entry ID**, and **Day Of Week**, which is also a non-key attribute, depends on **Date**. Now to resolve this to 3NF:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Entry ID:PK</th>
<th>Date:FK</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>3/10/2025</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Date:PK</th>
<th>Day Of Week</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3/10/2025</td>
<td>Friday</td>
</tr>
</table>
