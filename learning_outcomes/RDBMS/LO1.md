# Identify and use the processes and terminology used in designing a RDBMS

### Abstract

----------------------------------------------

Database normalization is the process of structuring relational databases in a way that reduces data redundancies and increases data integrity by reducing anomalies. It is accomplished by adhering to so-called normal forms that are sets of progressively strict rules constraining the database.

A relational database is an abstract idea of tables wherein columns (fields) and rows (records) are related in some way to columns and rows of other tables. A relational database management system (RDBMS) is software that provides tools necessary for creation and management of such tables, and for interaction with their data. An example here could be the `sqlite3` python library. It provides:

* tools to **create, read, update, and delete** (CRUD) data,

* a query language (SQL),

* enforcement of relational concepts such as **primary keys and foreign keys.**



There are three types of relationships in relational databases. Those are:

1. One-to-many Relationship: In this relationship, one record from table A can be associated with multiple records in table B.

2. Many-to-many Relationship: In this relationship, multiple records from table A can be associated with multiple records in table B.

3. One-to-one Relationship: 



Relational databases define two concepts called Entities and Attributes. An entity is a category of the thing or person you're trying to describe; for example an employee. An attribute is what you can use to describe that object with; for example, every employee has an ID and salary.
