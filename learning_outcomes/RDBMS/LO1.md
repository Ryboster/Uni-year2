# Identify and use the processes and terminology used in designing a RDBMS

## 30th Sept 2025

### Abstract

----------------------------------------------

Database normalization is the process of structuring relational databases in a way that reduces data redundancies and increases data integrity by reducing anomalies. It is accomplished by adhering to so-called normal forms that are sets of progressively strict rules constraining the database.

A relational database is an abstract idea of tables wherein columns and rows are related in some way to columns and rows of other tables. A relational database management system (RDBMS) is software that provides tools necessary for creation and management of such tables, and for interaction with their data. An example here could be the `sqlite3` python library. It provides:

* tools to **create, read, update, and delete** (CRUD) data,

*  a query language (SQL),

*  enforcement of relational concepts such as **primary keys and foreign keys.**
