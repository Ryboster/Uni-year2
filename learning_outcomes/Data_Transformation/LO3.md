### Abstract

----------------------------------------------

"People talking without speaking, people hearing without listening" - Simon, P. (1964) *The Sound of Silence*. Columbia Records.

To *hear* and to *listen* are two distinct things. To hear, in the context of the aforementioned lyrics, means to listen **passively**. This is as opposed to *listening*, which means to listen **actively**. But what exactly is the difference? Isn't hearing and listening the same thing anyway? What does it mean to listen **actively**? 

In this article, I will attempt to answer those questions, defining the term **active listening**, and demonstrating how it can be used to appreciate others' views and contributions.

### Body Section

----------------------------------------------

Communication is the exchange of information between two parties; the transmitter and receiver. In it, both parties play a role to ensure an effective flow of information, fostering clarity, understanding, and a mutual feeling of X. Communication can take both verbal and non-verbal forms, and while active listening can be performed in both, we're going to focus exclusively on verbal communication.



#### Passive Listening

Passive listening involves receiving information from the transmitter in a passive manner, without providing an acknowledgement of receipt, or any feedback. This approach to communication has the tendency of worsening understanding, increasing the number of errors, and significantly lowering the quality of the communication. 

#### Active Listening

Active listening involves not only receiving information from the transmitter, but also providing acknoledgement of receipt, as well as feedback. Doing so fosters teamwork, strengthens the relationship between the receiver and transmitter, and increases the efficiency of communication, which in turn promotes problem solving and significantly reduces the likelihood of errors.



It is very easy to spot the difference between a passive listener and an active one. A passive listener will just sit there, motionless, often with a vacant look in their eyes. Kind of looking like they're just waiting for the conversation to end. An active listener on the other hand, will nod, react, and provide some sort of feedback to the transmitter, making communication look a lot more like a conversation rather than lecture.
