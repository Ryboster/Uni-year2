### Abstract

Software development is a difficult process that only gets more difficult as the applications grow in size and complexity. It should come as no surprise then that over countless trials and errors, the most efficient methods emerged and quickly got adopted across the entire industry as standards.

This article discusses my application of some of those processes, methods, techniques, and tools.

#### Processes

##### Agile

##### Scrum

##### Kanban

#### Methods

##### Extreme Programming (XP)

##### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

#### Techniques

---

##### Pair Programming

##### Refactoring

##### Automated Testing

#### Tools

##### Version Control

Version control is a project management tool that enables developers to conveniently store every unique version of their applications in cloud. For simplicity, those versions can be thought of as video game saves. Should the need arise, developers can roll back to any previous version of their application and resume development from that point onward. Many version control services nowadays also include online views for purposes such as inspection.



##### Integrated Development Environment (IDEs)

IDEs, sometimes **wrongly** referred to as editors, are tools used for editing scripts. 



##### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
