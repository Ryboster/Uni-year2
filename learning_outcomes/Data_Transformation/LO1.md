### Abstract

---

Software development is a difficult process that only gets more difficult as the applications grow in size and complexity. It should come as no surprise then that over countless trials and errors, the most efficient methods emerged and quickly got adopted across the entire industry as standards.

This article discusses my application of some of those processes, methods, techniques, and tools.

#### Processes

---

##### Scrum

Scrum is an Agile process that focuses on developing software in cycles called "sprints". Each sprint lasts a predefined amount of time (usually a week), during which the team rendezvous for daily meetings whose goal it is to make sure that the development progresses smoothly. There are also "special" meetings at the beginning and end of each sprint called plannings, reviews, and retrospectives.



##### Kanban

Kanban (japanese for "signboard") is a process that focuses on task atomization and management. In kanban, teams will take an initiative and atomize 



##### Quality Assurance (QA)

#### Methods

---

##### Extreme Programming (XP)

##### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

#### Techniques

---

##### Pair Programming

##### Refactoring

##### Unit Testing





#### Tools

---

##### Version Control

Version control is a project management tool that enables developers to conveniently store every unique version of their applications in cloud. For simplicity, those versions can be thought of as video game saves. Should the need arise, developers can roll back to any previous version of their application and resume development from that point onward. Many version control services nowadays also include online views for purposes such as inspection.



##### Integrated Development Environment (IDEs)

IDEs, sometimes **wrongly** referred to as editors, are tools used for editing and compiling single, and sometimes even multiple scripts simultaneously. They include libraries used for spellchecking, error catching, and improving quality of life.



##### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

CI/CD workflows are tools for automatically performing routine tasks on codebases. They can be thought of, and are often referred to, as pipelines due to their
