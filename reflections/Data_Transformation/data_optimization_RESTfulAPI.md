# Data Optimization and Analysis in my Personal API

#### 25th October 2025

### What?

In October 2025, I have created my first ever RESTful API that I had since built a frontend for and transformed the whole application into a website for self promotion and showcasing.

Designing the application was a big undertaking as I had to ensure that it would stay relevant for a long time, allowing easy and time-efficient extension in the future. In addition to that the data presented needed to be easily editable, so appropriate tools needed to be made.







## So what?

To accomplish my goals, I have made use of Jinja2's blocks in my templates; most notably my `base.html` (Available at: [Personal_RESTful_API/templates/base.html at main · Ryboster/Personal_RESTful_API · GitHub](https://github.com/Ryboster/Personal_RESTful_API/blob/main/templates/base.html)), and my list_base.html (Available at: )









## Now what?

'Now what?' allows you to create an action plan for the future based on the previous questions.
